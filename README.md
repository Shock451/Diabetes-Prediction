# Diabetes Prediction API

Data Mining plays an important role in predicting outcomes in the medical field, as well as other scientific fields, enabling health systems to systematically use data and analytics to identify deficiencies and best practices that improve care and predict possible anomalies. 

Data mining—  a  process of selecting, exploring, and modeling large amounts of data to discover unknown patterns or relationships — has become an essential methodology for computing applications in medical informatics. 

Diabetes is caused by an increase in the level of blood glucose. 

Various traditional methods, based on physical and chemical tests have been used for diagnosing diabetes. 

The methods strongly based on data mining techniques can be effectively used to predict the risk of high blood pressure. 

The data mining process is so smooth that we could not recognize at all, which seem to be well-structured not disturbing our internet exploring, but it means they do not allow us to simply look at it. A number of problems of data mining and algorithms arrive at one terminal question: it’s all about transparency. 

We explore the early prediction of diabetes via five different data mining methods including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, DecisionTree, Prototype nearest Neighbor (PNN), K-Means Clustering, Binomial Logistic Regression (BLR), and Partial Least Square – Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA).

The PLS-DA turned out to be the best data mining method in the prediction of diabetes in terms of accuracy and speed. 

In future the data mining techniques have to be done more intrinsically to correlate diabetes with other diseases enabling the doctors and patients for a much more accurate and early detection of diabetes.
